quad 
----

This is a game based on Quarto. I have a CGI-based web interface 
for this somewhere. I'll add it after I find and tidy it up. For 
now this just comes with a *really* rough console interface that
I created mostly to test the rest of it interactively. 

No makefile for now. It compiles with: 

gcc -o quad main.c quad.c disp.c 

It isn't particularly special... it's a basic greedy algorithm. 
The function to check for a win is one line of bitwise math.
